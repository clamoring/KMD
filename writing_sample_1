task: Elevator pitch - "What is Komodo" 100 words or less.

Komodo is innovating Blockchain as a Service by providing bleeding-edge tools like a peer-to-peer decentralized exchange (BarterDEX), the ability to back up to another blockchain (Delayed Proof of Work), and the ability to conduct private financial transactions (zkSNARKs) on an open-source platform.
Developers, investors, and entreperneurs benefit from Komodoâ€™s modular platform. It provides turnkey solutinos for launching new assets in the Komodo ecosystem (or the freedom to stand alone), superior defense against some of the worst attacks facing assets today (like Double Spend, or the 51% Attack), and the ability to conduct business without exposing personal information.
