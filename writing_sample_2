Task: Elevator pitch - "What is Komodo" - 100 words or less

There are a lot of really exciting new uses for blockchain technology beyond the value a cryptocurrency itself provides. The Komodo ecosystem, (est. 2013) furnishes the tools and the infrastructure to innovate, grow, and utilize bleeding-edge technology - as it is being developed. For example, decentralized ICO (dICO) offers the ability to launch a new coin with a only few simple commands. BarterDEX is our exchange that provides the ability to trade one cryptocurrency for another directly with another person, rather than through a third party. The Komodo platform has many entry points, allowing diverse involvement options from investing to development.
